# Front-End Development Assignment Overview

As part of my Round 1 interview screening for a full-stack developer position, I undertook an assignment that focused on implementing a provided design using **NEXT.JS**. Here are the key aspects of my approach and implementation:

## Objective
The goal was to recreate a specified Figma design into a fully functional front-end application, ensuring fidelity to the original layout, spacing, typography, and color schemes.

## Implementation Details
- **Framework & Libraries Used:** I utilized **NEXT.JS** as the framework for building the application. For styling, I chose **Tailwind CSS** for its utility-first approach, which allowed for rapid development while maintaining a clean design.
- **Design Reproduction:** I carefully translated the design elements from Figma to ensure that the application is responsive across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **Technical Choices:** The implementation was done using React for building the UI components, while **shadcn** was integrated to enhance the user interface with pre-built components, streamlining the development process.

## Deployment
After completing the application, I deployed it on **Vercel** for easy access and sharing. I provided the live link and GitHub repository as required for submission.

## Enhancements
While the optional enhancements, such as TypeScript integration and unit testing with Jest, were not included in my submission, I focused on delivering a robust and responsive application that meets the design specifications.

This assignment has reinforced my skills in translating designs into functional applications and using modern front-end technologies effectively.

<!-- This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
